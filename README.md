astro-scripts
=============

These are some scripts I consider polished and/or useful enough for sharing. I have plenty more, but are either too specific or "dirty" for putting on here.

I am in love with the ruby gem "peach"; this is probably the only extra dependancy for my ruby scripts, and is installed with "gem i peach" or somesuch.
